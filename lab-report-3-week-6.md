2) __Setup Github Access from ieng6__

Show where the public key you made is stored on Github and in
your user account (screenshot).

Show where the private key you made is stored on your user
account (but not its contents) as a screenshot.

Show running git commands to commit and push a change to
Github while logged into your ieng6 account.

Show a link for the resulting commit.

3) __Copy whole directories with scp -r__

Show copying your whole markdown-parse directory to your ieng6
account.

Show logging into your ieng6 account after doing this and compiling
and running the tests for your repository.

Show (like in the last step of the first lab) combining scp, ;, and
ssh to copy the whole directory and run the tests in one line.
